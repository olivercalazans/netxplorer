# DataSeeker
DataSeeker is a command-line tool that collects information about devices. Completely made in Python with only one library dependency, it provides an easy-to-use interface for network exploration. This code is designed to run on Linux systems. However, it can also be used on Windows through WSL (I've done some basic testing, but not a full evaluation).

## Installation
This script is written in Python, so there's no need to install it. You only need to install the required library, scapy, for it to work. 
Itâ€™s recommended to install these libraries in a Python virtual environment for better dependency management.
