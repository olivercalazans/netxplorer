### mac_list.txt
This database contains a list of MAC addresses. These addresses are used by the "mac" command to identify,
when possible, the manufacturer of a device based on its MAC address.
It is based on the OUI data provided by the IEEE Standards Association but has been modified to suit the needs of this project.
